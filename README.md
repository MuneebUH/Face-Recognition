# Face Recognition Project

This project demonstrates a basic face recognition system using Python. The system loads a known image, encodes the face, and then compares it with an unknown image to identify and draw bounding boxes around recognized faces. The implementation uses the `face_recognition` library and `Pillow` for image processing and drawing.

## Features

- Load and encode known faces from images.
- Detect faces in unknown images.
- Compare detected faces with known faces to identify matches.
- Draw bounding boxes and labels around recognized faces.

## Requirements

- Visual Studio
- Python 3.x
- cmake library
- dlib library
- face_recognition library
- Pillow library (PIL)

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the images of known faces and the unknown image in the working directory.
2. Update the script with the paths to these images.
